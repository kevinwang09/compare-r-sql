# Why I am making this site?

1. I am already well-versed in `R` and `dplyr`, however, I would like to have a place to serve as a cheat-sheet for performing similar tasks in `SQL`
1. This is a place for me to document my self-learning during COVID-19. Hopefully this will be a good place to point to when I seek future employments.

# Structure

The rest of this site is organised into webpages at the top, with each webpage correspond to a specific task. Each webpage is organised into two columns, with `R` codes on the left and the `SQL` codes on the right, aiming to achieve the same tasks. 

# Code reproducibility

[![rmarkdown-build](https://github.com/kevinwang09/compare-r-sql/actions/workflows/rmarkdown-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kevinwang09/compare-r-sql/actions/workflows/rmarkdown-build.yaml)

This website is deployed through GitHub Actions using the workflow above. As such, the codes should be fully reproducible. 

The data that I have used are available in the same repository. The SQL set up is to use a local connection to a CSV file. It does not represent a typical workflow where one connects to a SQL server, though that is not the focus on this project.
